    <chapter xml:id="ch_intro">
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>With SaltNPepper we provide two powerful frameworks for dealing with linguistically
            annotated data. SaltNPepper is an Open Source project developed at the Humboldt
            University of Berlin (see: <link xlink:href="http://www.hu-berlin.de/"
                >http://www.hu-berlin.de/</link>) and INRIA (Institut national de recherche en
            informatique et automatique, see: <link xlink:href="http://www.inria.fr/"
                >http://www.inria.fr/</link>). In linguistic research a variety of formats exists,
            but no unified way of processing them. To fill that gap, we developed a meta model
            called Salt which abstracts over linguistic data. Based on this model, we also developed
            the pluggable universal converter framework Pepper to convert linguistic data between
            various formats. </para>
        <para>Pepper is a container controlling the workflow of a conversion process, the conversion
            itself is done by a set of modules called Pepper modules mapping the linguistic data
            between a given format and Salt and vice versa. Pepper is a highly pluggable framework
            which offers the possibility to plug in new modules in order to incorporate further
            formats. The architecture of Pepper is flexible and makes it possible to benefit from
            all already existing modules. This means that when adding a new or previously unknown
            format Z to Pepper, it is automatically possible to map data between Z and all already
            supported formats A, B, C, … . A Pepper workflow consists of three phases: <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>the import phase (mapping data from a given fromat to Salt),</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>the optional manipulation phase (manipulating or enhancing data in Salt)
                        and the</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>export phase (mapping data from Salt to a given format).</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist> The three phase process makes it feasible to influence and manipulate
            data during conversion, for example by adding additional information or linguistic
            annotations, or by merging data from different sources.</para>
        <para>Since Pepper is a pluggable framework, we used an underlying framework called OSGi
            (see: <link xlink:href="http://www.osgi.org/">http://www.osgi.org/</link>) that provides
            such a functionality. OSGi is a mighty framework and has a lot of impact in the way of
            programming things in java. Because we do not want to force you to learn OSGi, when you
            just want to create a new module for pepper, we tried to hide the OSGi layer as good as
            possible. Therefore, and for the lifecycle management of such projects, we used another
            framework named maven (see: <link xlink:href="http://maven.apache.org/"
                >http://maven.apache.org/</link>). Maven is configured via an xml file called
            pom.xml, you will find it in all SaltNPepper projects and also in the root of the
            SampleModule project. Maven makes things easier for use especially in dealing with
            dependencies. </para>
        <para>The SaltNPepper framework also comes with an environment for a direct start up in
            Eclipse. for an easier development of a Pepper module. It further contains a test bed
            for checking simple consistency issues of Pepper modules. This test bed is based on
            JUnit (see: <link xlink:href="junit.org">junit.org</link>) and can easily be extended
            for a specific module test.</para>
        <para>In the following, <xref linkend="ch_setUpEnv"/> explains how to set up your
            environment to start developing your Pepper module. <xref linkend="ch_sampleModule"/>
            explains how to download and adopt a template module to your own needs. This module then
            is the base for your own module. In <xref linkend="sec_customization"/> we explain how
            to add properties to your module, so that the user can dynamically customize the
            behaviour of the mapping. <xref linkend="ch_documentation"/> shows the usage of a
            documentation template written in doocbook (see <link
                xlink:href="http://www.docbook.org/">http://www.docbook.org/</link>) to make a
            standard documentation for the user of your module. Since testing of software often is a
            pain in the back, the <classname>pepper-testSuite</classname> already comes with some
            predefined tests. They should save you some time. Last but not least, this documentation
            contains a FAQ. Since a FAQ lives of questions, if you have some, just help us
            increasing that part and send a mail to
            <email>saltnpepper@lists.hu-berlin.de</email>.</para>
