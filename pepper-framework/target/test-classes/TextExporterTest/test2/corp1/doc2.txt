With SaltNPepper we provide two powerful frameworks for dealing with linguistically annotated data. SaltNPepper is an Open Source project developed at the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin and INRIA (Institut national de recherche en informatique et automatique). In linguistic research a variety of formats exists, but no unified way of processing them. To fill that gap, we developed a meta model called Salt which abstracts over linguistic data. Based on this model, we also developed the pluggable universal converter framework Pepper to convert linguistic data between various formats.
