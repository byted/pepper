#Pepper
Pepper is a pluggable, Java-based, open source converter framework for linguistic data. It was developed to convert data from a linguistic data format _X_ to another linguistic data format _Y_. With Pepper, you can convert data from and into all supported formats. For instance from <a href="http://www.exmaralda.org/">EXMARaLDA</a> format to <a href="http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/ressourcen/werkzeuge/TIGERSearch/doc/html/TigerXML.html">Tiger XML</a>, or <a href="http://mmax2.sourceforge.net/">MMAX</a>
to <a href="http://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/annis/">ANNIS</a> format or <a href="http://www.wagsoft.com/RSTTool/">Treetagger</a> output and <a href="">RST</a> to <a href="https://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/en/paula.html">PAULA</a> and many many more.

To decrease the number of conceptual mappings, Pepper follows the intermediate model approach, which means that a conversion consists of two mappings. First, the data coming from format _X_ will be mapped to the intermediate model <a href="http://u.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper">Salt</a> and second, the data will be mapped from Salt to format _Y_. If you imagine a set of n source and target formats, then this approach will decrease the number of mappings from _nÂ²-n_ mappings in case of the direct mapping approach to _2n_ mappings.

The Pepper framework itself is just a container controlling the workflow of a conversion process. The mapping itself is done by a set of Pepper modules. Pepper is a highly pluggable framework which offers the possibility to plug-in new modules in order to incorporate further formats. The flexibel architecture of Pepper allows to combine all existing modules and to easily plug-in new ones. The Pepper workflow is separated into three different phases:
<ul>
  <li>the import phase (mapping data from a given fromat to Salt),</li>
  <li>the optional manipulation phase (manipulating or enhancing data in Salt) and the</li>
  <li>export phase (mapping data from Salt to a given format).</li> 
</ul>
The three phase process makes it feasible to influence and manipulate data during conversion, for example by adding additional information or linguistic annotations, or by merging data from different sources.

The import phase handles the mapping from a format _X_ to Salt, the export phase handles the mapping from Salt to a format _Y_. During the manipulation phase, the data in Salt can be enhanced, reduced or manipulated. A phase is divided into several steps: the import and export phase must contain at least one step each. Whereas the manipulation phase can contain any number of steps. Each Pepper module realizes exactly one step. For instance the import of data in the EXMARaLDA format is done by one module, the EXMARaLDAImporter. The orchestration of Pepper modules is determined by the Pepper workflow description file (.pepperparams). A Pepper module can be identified by specifying it name or the format's name and version of the corpus to be converted.

##Download and Install

Here you will find the current stable release, snapshots and even older versions of Pepper including a set of Pepper modules.

* <a href="https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper/pepper/download/snapshot/">Snapshot Releases</a>

Pepper is system independent and comes as a ready to run zip archive, so you do not need any
installation. But since Pepper is Java based, you need to have Java installed on your system. On most
systems, Java is installed by default, but in case it is not please download it from
www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/ or http://openjdk.java.net/. To check if Java (or more precisly a Java
Runtime Environment) is running, open a command line and run:
```bash
java -version
```
You need at least version 1.6.

## Running Pepper

To run Pepper open a command line and enter (for windows):

```
pepperStart.bat ARGUMENTS
```

or (for linux, unix and Mac OS):

```
bash pepperStart.sh ARGUMENTS
```
To get a list of all available arguments, enter 'help' as argument:
```
pepperStart.bat help
```
If no argument are given, Pepper starts the interactive command line and displays the Pepper prompt:
```
pepper>
```
To get a list of all available commands, enter 'help'. 
To start a conversion by a given workflow description file enter the command 'convert' followed by the file.
```
pepper>convert mySampleWorkflow.pepper
```
If you do not already have a workflow description file, enter just 'convert' and Pepper starts the conversion wizzard.

### Conversion Wizzard

1. Enter the path of the corpus to import e.g. 'C:\myCorpus\':
     
     ```
     pepper/wizzard/importer>C:\myCorpus\
     ```
1. Now Pepper displays a list of all available importers and asks you to choose one of them. 
     
     ```
     +------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
     | no   | module name                   | format                                   |
     +------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
     | * 1  | TextImporter                  | (txt, 0.0)                               |
     |   2  | SaltXMLImporter               | (SaltXML, 1.0)                           |
     |   3  | DoNothingImporter             | (doNothing, 0.0)                         |
     ```
     A '*' next to the number of the importer shows, that this importer is recommended. Recommended means that the passed path contains files in a format, the importer is able to process. 
     To choose an importer, just enter its number or its name.
     ```
     pepper/wizzard/importer>1
     ```

1. Some importers provide a list of properties to customize the import. If this is the case, Pepper displays a list of all available customization properties.
      ```
     +----+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
     | no | property name                 | description                              |
     +----+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
     | 1  | pepper.before.addSLayer       | Consumes a semicolon separated list of   |
     |    |                               | names for {@link SLayer} objects. For    |
     ...
     ```
     To use a property, enter its number or name, followed by '=' and the value of the property.
     ```
     pepper/wizzard/importer>1=anyValue
     ```
     Pepper keeps asking you to enter further customization properties until you enter an empty line.
1. Since it is possible to use more than one importers for one workflow, Pepper asks you to enter a further corpus path. To skip that press just 'enter'. 
1. In Pepper you have the possibility to manipulate the data between the im- and the export phase. Therefore Pepper displays a list of all available manipulators and asks you to enter the  number or name of a manipulator. To skip adding a manipulator press just 'enter'. 
1. Also manipulators can be customized and when the choosen manipulator provides properties for customization Pepper displays them and asks you for entering such a property.
1. To skip the adding of further manipulators press just 'enter'.
1. The last thing remains is to choose an exporter. Pepper shows a list of all available exporters. To choose one of them enter its number or its name.
1. Again you have the chance to customize the export by adding some customization properties, if provided. To do so, enter the number or name of a property followed by '=' and the value.
1. Along with importers and manipulators, you can add more than one exporter. To stop adding exporters, enter an empty line.
1. To save the workflow enter 'save' followed by a path  where to store the file (.pepper).
     ```
     pepper/wizzard>C:\myCorpus\myWorkflow.pepper
     ```
1. To start the conversion enter 'start'.

     ```
     pepper/wizzard>start
     ```
1. To exit and abort the conversion enter 'exit'.

##Modules

Pepper is just a container to control the conversion workflow. The real power comes from the single Pepper modules. A lot of modules for Pepper are already pluged in when downloading Pepper. A list of available Pepper modules can be found [here](./gh-site/modules.md).

To install a further module into an existing Pepper instance open the Pepper console and use command 'is':
```
pepper>is PATH_TO_PLUGIN
```

To update a module, open the Pepper console and use command 'update'
```
update GROUP_ID::ARTIFACT_ID::REPOSITORY
```

You can also install or update a module manually, by copying it. In most cases a Pepper module is provided as a zip file containing the module as a .jar file, and a folder having the same name as the jar file. This folder contains the license files, documentations and other resources the Pepper module needs. Unzip the file and copy its content to the plugin folder of Pepper (PEPEPR_HOME/plugins). When you want to update a module, make sure to delete the existing module by removing the .jar file and the folder.

## Create a new module

In case, the available modules does not solve your problem, you can also implement an own module to support another format or to manipulate the data during the conversion process. Please read the <a href="http://korpling.github.io/pepper/docs/pepper_modulesDevelopersGuide.pdf">Module Developer's Guide</a> to get a detailed documentation of how to implement a Pepper module. A list of needed OSGi modules, for testing Pepper can be found [here](./gh-site/osgi.md).
